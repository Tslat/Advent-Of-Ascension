Butchery (Skill)

Bloodlust. Delicious, destructive bloodlust. Butchery is all about dealing damage, and dealing as much of it as possible. Occasionally, when you are meleeing a target, a little red orb will drop off and start floating away. This is bloodlust. Craft yourself a blood accumulator, and use it on a bloodlust to gain xp.

As you level up your Butchery skill, you'll recharge your Battle Rage quicker, and deal even more damage when it activates.
An essential trait for any budding warrior!
