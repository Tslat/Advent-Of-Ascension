Hauling (Skill)

When you're done slaying monsters and digging around, take a rest and do some relaxing fishing. The hauling skill gives you access to some very useful fishing rewards not normally available otherwise.
When you pull up a fish, you may find that you get a much more nutritious fish instead of a normal one. If you're lucky, you may even get some sort of treasure! When you do pull one of these up from the depths, you'll gain a bit of Hauling xp.

The more you level up your Hauling level, the better the loot you'll find!
Some of the fish hiding away down there may be some of the most nutritious meals around..
