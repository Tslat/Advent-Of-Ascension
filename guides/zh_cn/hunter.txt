Hunter (Skill)

While Hauling is about taking a break and relaxing with a nice fishing rod, Hunter is the exact opposite - it's about stabbing stuff in the face. Or anywhere else.
You may notice while wandering around that some creatures have an icon of two crossed swords floating above their head.
These icons indicate that the creature is a Hunter creature. Hunter creatures give Hunter xp when killed, but they can only be attacked if you have the required Hunter level to do so.
Hunter creatures tend to give decent rewards, and the higher level ones especially tend to give unique loot.

Remember: Green swords = ATTACK! Red swords = Do something other than attack. Make a sandwich? I don't know.
