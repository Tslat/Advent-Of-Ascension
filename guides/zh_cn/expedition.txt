远征（技能）

这是一个老少皆宜的技能。远征是一个围绕着探索和运动的技能。
当你在世界中自由的疾跑时，j就会偶尔获得一些远征经验。就这么简单！

随着你远征等级的提升，你的腿部力量会逐渐增强并且会受到越来越少的摔落伤害。

Expedition also has a secondary effect. Every now and then while running around, you will be briefly revitalised by your expedition prowess. The exact effect depends on which buff you have chosen in the player menu. Click on the Expedition icon to toggle between effects.
The power and frequency of this effect increases depending on your Expedition level.

Speed:
  Choose the gust of wind icon to select the speed buff. While running around, you may gain a brief speed boost, allowing you to travel even faster!

Satiation:
  Choose the food icon to select the satiation buff. While running around, you may suddenly find yourself a little less hungry than before. Stretch your valuable food resources out!

Deep Breath:
  Choose the bubble icon to select the deep breath buff. While swimming, you may suddenly find some additional oxygen to hang onto, allowing you to swim even longer without surfacing.
