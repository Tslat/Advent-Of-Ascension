Getting Started

Welcome to Advent of Ascension!

This mod is a big one, and it covers a number of areas of Minecraft - so it's a bit easy to get lost. But don't worry! There are a few things we can start off with to get you set up!

First of all, you're going to want to find shelter. The overworld is no longer safe, and as such it's very important that you have a place to retreat in order to recharge and heal.
Your best bet is to quickly grab a pickaxe and dig your way into a hill, or into the ground. Make a small hole and mark it on the outside so you know where to find it later.

From there, you will want to take your time building up your resources so that you don't starve, and equipping yourself with some basic armour and a weapon. The main thing to remember is to be careful!

Once you're ready to go, you're going to want to go very deep underground and start digging around for a ruined teleporter frame. It will appear as a big black crumbled structure, guarded by a Corrupted Traveller.
Help him out, and he'll give you something to keep you going.

Good luck! You're going to need it...
