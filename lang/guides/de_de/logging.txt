Logging (Skill)

Logging is a lot like Foraging. It allows you to find additional useful loot while cutting down trees. Whenever you break down some wood, you have a small chance to find some additional shiny trinkets. Whenever you do so, you'll also gain a bit of Logging xp.
Keep levelling up your Logging skill, and you'll find that you get better trinkets, and more often too!

Remember to replant your trees though, otherwise you may end up turning your forest into a desert, and then there's no more loot for you!
