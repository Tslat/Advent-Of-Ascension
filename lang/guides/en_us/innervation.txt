Innervation (Skill)

Innervation is the skill of vitality. Every time you kill a creature, it may drop a small shard of its vitality in the form of a heart stone. This heart stone can then be picked up by you to gain a little bit of innervation xp.

As you level up your Innervation skill, you'll occasionally be able to utilise this additional absorbed vitality to withstand or dodge incoming attacks, or even use them to your advantage!

That's not too hard, right?
