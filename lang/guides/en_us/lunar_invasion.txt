Lunar Invasion (Event)

"The world just got stranger."
The void of Lunalus has seeped its way into the overworld.
On some nights, the dimensional border between Lunalus and our world becomes breached. Alien creatures from that dimension begin to pour through, offering up new ways to die in your sleep.

These creatures may not act in the same way as you'd expect from other overworld creatures, due to their alien nature. Because of this, it is worthwhile taking additional caution if you plan to deal with the intruders yourself.

Luckily, the breach never stays long, and once the night passes the creatures will begin to die off.
