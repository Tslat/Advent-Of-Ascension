Soul Scurry (Event)

"Lost souls scurry across the world in the darkness."
Some nights, the souls of those once dead return to the world of the living to resolve their unfinished intentions.
On these nights, ghostly versions of creatures you may have slain in the past return to the living, and continue where they left off, with the added benefit of less fleshy bodies.

Once the night passes, the ghostly visitors will return to their rest.
