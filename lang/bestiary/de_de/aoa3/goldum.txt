One of the spiritual creations of the Immortallis dungeons, Goldum are passive constructs that exist less as a creature, and more as a totem of sorts.

Like all Immortallis creations, it doesn't leave behind a corporeal form upon death, instead simply vanishing to return its energy to the dungeon.
Unlike most other Immortallis creations however, Goldum will leave behind a lump of refined gold when killed, until the dungeon's requirements are satisfied.
