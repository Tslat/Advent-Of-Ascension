A hulking giant seemingly made entirely from ice, this monstrosity can be rarely found wandering around the coldest of wastelands, ruling as king of the food chain in the area.
They don't like to compete for territory with others of its kind, nor do they work together well, so you will usually only see them in solitary isolation

Despite their enormous size and incompatibility with other Ice Giants, they are generally not inclined to attack at random, and instead only hunt for food as necessary, or in retaliation if attacked first.
Don't assume this means they are lacking in the combat department however, as they are more than capable of wiping out even the most prepared invaders if provoked.
