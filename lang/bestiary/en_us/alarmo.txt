Like most of the other Vox Ponds creatures, the Alarmo seems to have become mutated and merged with some of the surrounding structures, combining its previously natural head with a metallic cage.

Alarmos are an unconventionally frightening creature, using its loud alarm-like screech to draw attention from nearby creatures when it feels threatened.
On its own, it won't attack any potential threat and instead resorts to attempting to use nearby hostile creatures to protect it.
