Bugeyes are your typical 6-legged insect, with the slight difference that they're 3-feet tall. Besides their unusually large size, Bugeyes are almost entirely unremarkable.
The single exception to this is their single eye, which is likely to give the creature poor vision compared to its smaller insect counterparts.

Like a parasitic insect, Bugeyes are aggressive and will chase and bite whatever it feels like, whenever it feels like.
