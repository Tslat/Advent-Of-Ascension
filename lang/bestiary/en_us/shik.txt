Shik are small crab-like creatures that roam the Deeplands, utilising the rocky landscape to its fullest for countless hiding spots.
They are almost always found hiding inside rocky outcrops, skittering away once found.

They are extremely timid creatures, running frantically away from just about anything that moves.
Interestingly, they exhibit an unusual behaviour when meeting up with other Shiks, briefly performing a greeting or dance of some kind.
